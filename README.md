# run-buddy program

## Description:

* This website is designed to help people to find their personal trainer based on their personal goals. 
* This project was completed based on the basic HTML & CSS concepts, producing an intuitive, neat demonstration of the business model provided by "run-buddy".
* By using this tool, the "run-buddy" program associate can generate sales leads and make contacts with the customers who have filled out the form.
* During the process of building the website (my "first coding journey"), I have learned the tools & skills necessary to design a website that is clear, SEO friendly and how to troubleshoot the mysterious mistakes using Chrome's DevTools.

## Built By:
* HTML
* CSS

## How to Install:

Windows Users: 
* Open Gitbash, navigate towards your project location from your root by using "cd ./ project location"
* Choose a clone option from my "run-buddy" repository (either HTTPS or SSH should work)
* In Gitbash, type "git clone HTTPS or SSH"
* Once the clone is successful, you are ready to go!

MacOS Users:
Coming Soon!
