# run-buddy program

##Description:
1. This website is designed to help people to find their personal trainer based on their personal goals. 
2. This project was completed based on the basic HTML & CSS concepts, producing an intuitive, neat demonstration of the business model provided by "run-buddy".
3. By using this tool, the "run-buddy" program associate can generate sales leads and make contacts with the customers who have filled out the form.
4. During the process of building the website (my "first coding journey"), I have learned the tools & skills necessary to design a website that is clear, SEO friendly and how to troubleshoot the mysterious mistakes using Chrome's DevTools.

##How to Install:
Windows Users: 
1. Open Gitbash, navigate towards your project location from your root by using "cd ./ project location"
2. Choose a clone option from my "run-buddy" repository (either HTTPS or SSH should work)
3. In Gitbash, type "git clone HTTPS or SSH"
4. Once the clone is successful, you are ready to go!
MacOS Users:
Coming Soon!
